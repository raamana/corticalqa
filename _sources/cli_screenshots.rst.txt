Generating Screenshots
----------------------

In some scenarios, you may want to save take a screenshot of the advanced visualizations generated by VisualQC,
e.g., either for future reference or to reuse them in a presentation or another way you desire.
This can be easily be achieved by adding the ``--screenshot_only`` flag to the command line to any of the QC modules
offered by VisualQC. With this flag, VisualQC would disable interactive elements, enter a batch mode and
saves the screenshots of the complex visualizations for each subject to the output folder.
You can customize these visualizations with different visualization type or layouts via other CLI args. Examples screenshots generated for a few modules are shown at the end of this page.


Please note **we** *strongly* **discourage** any ideas of using these static screenshots for QC purposes

- screenshots can and do become out of sync with data on disk
- screenshots are static and do not allow zooming-in or proper review of different types of data
- VisualQC rendering is so blazing fast in most cases, that you can always fire it up if you need to show any subject or data to colleagues, and have the full power and capability of VisualQC while doing so.


Hence, please carefully consider the tradeoffs in how you choose to implement the QC procedure for your use-case,
as it would be quite disheartening to lose the effort put in towards or having to redo it again
because QCing static screenshots wasn't considered sufficient by reviewers.
